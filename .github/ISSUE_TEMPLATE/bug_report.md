**Twitch client installed classic/retail version on retail/classic**
<!-- if you are here to report an issue with wrong version of DBM installed on your game version, that is an issue you need to report to twitch support, not here. DBM correctly releases correct versions for correct game versions. There exists a bug in twitch client where for whatever reason it gets the two backwards. This issue seems to come and go and for SOME REASON twitch can't seem to figure out why. They just keep saying it's "resolved" only to have issue come back hours/days later, again and again and again. Any tickets created for this will be immediately closed since there is NOTHING that can be done on DBMs end. If your issue is something else related to DBM, continue on -->
